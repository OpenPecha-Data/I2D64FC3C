XVIII. THE MERITS OF HAVING FAITH IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE ESSENCE OF BUDDHAHOOD

(§1. The Superiority of Faith over Other Virtues in Regard to Their Merits.) Hereafter, with reference to the advantage o
f faith possessed by those who are believing in these [4] subjects which have been duly described above, we have six ślo
kas.

(Kārikās 1-6) The Essence of Buddhahood, the Enlightenment of the Buddha, The Buddha’s Properties, and the Buddha’s Acts,
They are inconceivable even to those of the pure mind, Being the exclusive sphere of the Leaders. || 1 ||But the wise o
ne, whose intellect accepts the faith In this exclusive sphere of the Buddha, Becomes a receptacle of the whole collecti
on of properties, And, being possessed of the desire [to obtain] The inconceivable properties [of the Buddha], He surpaś
es the abundance of merits of all living beings. || 2 ||Suppose there were one who, being anxious to obtain the Enlighte
nment, Would offer golden lands, constructed by jewels As innumerable as the sands in the Buddha’s lands, To the Lord of
Doctrine, always, day after day; Another if he hear but one word of this teaching, After hearing of it, would have fait
h in this Doctrine; The latter would reap merits far more than the merits of an offering. || 3 ||Suppose a wise man, bei
ng desirous of the Highest Enlightenment, Would keep pure moral conduct by his body, speech and mind, Without effort, in
course of innumerable aeons; Another, if he hear but one word of this teaching, After hearing of it, would have faith i
n this Doctrine; The latter would reap merits far more than the merits of morality. || 4 ||Suppose one would give himsel
f up to the mystic absorption; Which suppreśes the fire of defilements in the worlds, And, having been transferred to th
e abode of Brahman in heaven, Would be irreversible from the means of Enlightenment; Another, if he hear but one word of
this teaching, After hearing of it, would have faith in this Doctrine; The latter would reap merits far more than even 
the merits of the mystic absorption. || 5 ||Charity brings people only to [worldly] enjoyment, Morality leads people to 
the blissful world, And meditation is conducive to the removal of Defilements, But the Transcendental Intellect can remo
ve All [the obscurations of] defilements and ignorance. Therefore, Intellect is the supreme one [of all virtues] And its
very source is the study of this Doctrine. || 6 ||The summarized meaning of these ślokas should be known by the followi
ng 9 verses. The basis [of Buddhahood], its transformation, Its properties and the performance of welfare, In these four
aspects of the sphere of Buddha’s Wisdom, Which have been explained above, || 7 ||The wise one has become full of faith
With regard to its existence, power and virtue, Therefore, he quickly attains the potentialit yOf acquiring the state o
f the Tathāgata. || 8 ||Indeed, as he is full of devotion and faith That there exists ‘this’ inconceivable sphere, That 
it ‘can’ be realized by one like him, And this sphere, ‘endowed with such virtues’ has been attained, || 9 ||So in him t
he mind intent on Enlightenment, Being a receptacle of virtues like zeal, energy, Memory, contemplation, Transcendental 
Intellect, etc., Comes to exist always. || 10 ||As this mind constantly exists, The son of the Buddha becomes irreversib
le, And he reaches the accomplishment and the perfect purity, With regard to the Highest of Merits. || 11 ||‘The [Highes
t of] Merits’ means the [first] Highest virtues, ‘Its accomplishment’ is owing to his being non-discriminative With rega
rd to the three aspects [of activity], And ‘the perfect purity’ is caused by his removal of the opponents. || 12 ||Chari
ty is the merit consisting of granting gift, Morality is the merit consisting of moral conduct, And both Patience and Me
ditation, is that of practice, But Exertion is the merit common to all. || 13 ||Discrimination regarding the aspects of 
activity, That is the Obscuration of Ignorance; The opponents [to the Highest Virtues], jealousy, etc., They are the Obs
curations of Defilements. || 14 ||But, without the Highest Intellect, The other cannot be the cause of their removal; Th
erefore, the Highest Intellect is the supreme one of all, And, as the source of it is the study [of this Doctrine], It i
s this study that is the most important. || 15 ||(§2. Authority, Motive, and Characteristics of This Text Being the Corr
ect Doctrine.) [Hereafter we have ślokas mentioning on which basis, for what motive, and how this doctrine has been expl
ained and what characteristics it has. First of all, with reference to the basis and motive, there is one śloka]. (Kārik
ā 7) Thus, on the basis of the authoritative Scripture and of Logic, This treatise is expounded by me in order to attain
Perfect purification for myself, exclusively; At the same time, however, this is in order to aśist Those intelligent pe
ople who are endowed with faith And accomplishment of virtues. || 16 ||[Next we have one śloka stating how this treatise
is explained]. (Kārikā 8) Just as, with the aid of a lamp, of lightning, Of a precious stone, of the moon and the sun, 
Those possessed of vision can perceive objects; Similarly, I have expounded this treatise Relying upon the Lord who is t
he sun Manifesting the Doctrine of great welfare. || 17 ||[Then we have one śloka stating the characteristics of the cor
rect doctrine]. (Kārikā 9) Whatever the word that is connected with the scriptural texts It pursues the [ultimate] aim [
of living beings], Is conducive to removing the Defilements in the Worlds, And can demonstrate the advantage of Quiescen
ce, Such a word is that of the Great Sage, And all others are of perverse character. || 18 ||[Next we have one śloka sta
ting by what means this treatise is explained]. (Kārikā 10) Whatever is spoken by those whose mind is not distracted And
who refer to the Lord as the only Preceptor, And is favourable to the Path of the [2] Accumulations which lead to Emanc
ipation, That is also to be accepted with respect As if it were taught by the Great Sage. || 19 ||(§3. The Means of Pres
erving Oneself within the Doctrine.) [Here we have two ślokas referring to the means of preserving oneself from becoming
deprived (of this Doctrine)] (Kārikās 11-12) Indeed in this world there is no one wiser than the Buddha, No other who i
s omniscient and knows completely The highest Truth according to the right method; Therefore, the Scripture should not b
e interpolated, Which is discoursed by the Sage himself, Otherwise, it will do harm to the Highest Doctrine Because of d
estroying the teaching of the Buddha. || 20 ||The fact that people abuse the Sages And blame the doctrine taught by the 
Sages, All this is the Defilement of those whose nature is foolish And is created by a prejudiced conception; Therefore,
your mind should not be attached To the dirt of the prejudiced conception; Indeed, only clean cloth can be dyed But not
one that is spoiled by oil and dust. || 21 ||(§4. Causes and Results of the loss of the Doctrine.) [With reference to t
he causes of the loss of the Doctrine, there is one śloka]. (Kārikā 13) Want of intelligence, want of faith in the virtu
ous Doctrine, Indulgence in false pride, Obscured nature through the rejection of the Highest Doctrine, Interpretation o
f the conventional sense as the [ultimate] Truth, Greediness, [adherence to] false conception, Devotion to those who hat
e the Doctrine, Keeping at distance from those who convey the Doctrine, And delighting in the inferior Doctrine, By all 
this, one becomes deprived of the Doctrine of the Saint. || 22 ||[With reference to the result of this loss, there are t
wo ślokas]. (Kārikās 14-15) The wise one need not be so much afraid of fire, Of violent poison of snake, of murder, or o
f lightning, As he should be afraid of the loss of the profound Doctrine, Because a fire, a snake, an enemy, and lightni
ng, At most, may deprive one of [this] life But one will not go, by these causes, To the most terrible world of Avīci. |
| 23 ||Even one who, repeatedly serving bad friends, Is hostile to the Buddha, and commits the acts Of killing mother, f
ather, and the Saints, And breaks the unity of the Highest Community, Even that one can quickly become delivered from th
at sin If he meditates upon the meaning of the Doctrine; But, how would it be pośible for the Liberation to arise In one
whose mind is hostile to the Doctrine! || 24 ||(§5. Conclusion.) [Here, at the end we have one śloka in order to turn t
he merit acquired by the author through this teaching towards the people]. (Kārikā 16) I have thus duly expounded the su
bjects, The Jewels, the perfectly pure Essence, The Immaculate Enlightenment, the [Buddha’s] Properties and Acts; By the
merit I have acquired through this, May all living beings come to perceive The Lord Amitāyus endowed with infinite ligh
t, And, having seen him, may they, owing to the arising Of the immaculate vision of the Doctrine in them, Obtain the Sup
reme Enlightenment. || 25 ||The summary of topics discussed in these 10 ślokas (vv. 16-25) should be known by the follow
ing verses. Owing to what basis, for what motive, How and what is expounded [in this treatise], And what is the natural 
outflow [of the Buddha’s Doctrine], These topics are explained by the [first] ślokas. || 26 ||Two ślokas refer to the me
ans of self-protection, And one, to the cause of the loss [of the Doctrine], And then, the [following] two ślokas Explai
n the result of this loś. || 27 ||And finally, the acceptance [of the Doctrine] By those living in the world of Saṃsāra 
And their acquisition of Enlightenment; In short, these results of teaching of the meaning Of the Doctrine are explained
by the last śloka. || 28 ||

Thus is finished the fifth chapter entitled ‘the Merits of Faith’ in the ANALYSIS OF THE GERM OF THE JEWELS, a Treatise o
n the Ultimate Doctrine of the Great Vehicle with the commentary [named] ‘the Summary of meaning of the ślokas’. || 5 ||
